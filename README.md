# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

My first React App! An employee directory! 
Helped me with comprehension of a React application's UI. Divided into React elements consisting of components, management of those component states, and respond to user events. Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information and to be able to filter employees by name, email, and phone number.

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Installation
  ``` $ npm start ```

## Technologies Utilized
  * jQuery
  * CSS/HTML
  * Bootstrap
  * axios
  * node.js
  * Heroku
  * React!!
